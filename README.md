### Rationale

The most frustrating thing about wanting to join a club is not knowing where to start. Knowing that clubs are out there and that people participate, but you yourself are not in the “know”. That is where The Book Club website comes in.
In essence, it is a website that allows members and co-ordinators to communicate, organise and participate in a Book Club. It details which books will be read in the coming month, where the book meetings will be held and how to get involved. It will also provide an online sign-up form with the prices clearly stated in a no-hidden-fees manner. 
Users will sign up to the club, agree to a monthly subscription, pick a club to join, receive their first book and know where to attend their first meeting.
