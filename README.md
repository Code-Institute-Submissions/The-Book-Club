# The Book Club

### Live website - https://cgpalmer.github.io/The-Book-Club/
___


## Rationale

The most frustrating thing about wanting to join a club is not knowing where to start. Knowing that clubs are out there and that people participate, but you yourself are not in the “know”. That is where The Book Club website comes in.
In essence, it is a website that allows members and co-ordinators to communicate, organise and participate in a Book Club. It details which books will be read in the coming month, where the book meetings will be held and how to get involved. It will also provide an online sign-up form with the prices clearly stated in a no-hidden-fees manner. 
Users will sign up to the club, agree to a monthly subscription, pick a club to join, receive their first book and know where to attend their first meeting.

## UX

The website is for people who are interested in joining a regular, organised book club. The website is also for people who are part of the book club already and will need to access information.  

The website will be split into different pages. 

   + The “Home” page will have details about the club and what to expect from the meetings. It will contain a section with information for people to trial the book club. It will also have the prices for each subscription at the bottom of the page.
   + The “Sign Up” page will let the user sign-up and select a subscription.
   + The “Meetings” page will have more details about each location and the book they are currently reading.
   + The “Members’ login” page where they can login to add their details and receive their book. 
   + The “Contact Us” modal is where anyone can get in touch with The Book Club company via email, phone or mail. It also has social media links.

The user should be able to gain the following information:

   + Information about The Book Club and how it works.
   + What different subscriptions are on offer and the benefits for each
   + What book is currently being read in each place
   + Where the meetings take place
   + Information on how to find each place
   + Information on how to sign up.

### Technologies Used

Languages used
   1.	HTML
   2.	CSS
   3.	Javascript  

Bootstrap – https://getbootstrap.com/  
The project uses Bootstrap to simplify the process of building a grid layout, implementing carousels and forms, cards, and creating buttons. Bootstrap was also used for responsive design. 

JQuery – https://jquery.com/  
JQuery was not used discreetly by me. However, elements of Bootstrap used JQuery and Javascript, therefore I have added the necessary scripts on each page.
